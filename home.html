<p>Please join us here on our server!</p>
<p>As we grow bigger we will be adding more and more information.</p>
<p>So far there is documentation here only for <a href="https://xiweb.catsangel.com/">xiweb</a>, which is an AGPL site that collects information from a <a href="https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server">LandSandBoat</a> server running on the same machine.</p>
<p>The LandSandBoat project is an open-source server emulator for the MMORPG Final Fantasy XI.<p>
<ul>
  <li>The overall stated goal of the LandSandBoat project is to be as retail-like as they can be.</li>
  <li>Developers for LandSandBoat are working from actual captured data from sessions spent on retail FFXI to build the LandSandBoat repository manually, using <strong>zero</strong> proprietary retail code.</li>
  <li>This means that the creation progress of the codebase for LandSandBoat can be slow going at times.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://github.com/LandSandBoat/server/wiki/What-Works"><strong>What Works</strong></a> page of the LandSandBoat wiki is a little behind the actual state of the project, but is a fair approximation for the most part.</li>
  <li>There are many entries on the What Works page indicating content in progress which are still in progress, but they are actually further along then the chapters indicateted there, but still a long ways away from completion.</li>
</ul>
<p>TLDR: Anything that is on the base branch of the LandSandBoat project is what you will find here on xiweb, there are zero differences/customizations here from what LandSandBoat offers. We basically are a staging point of sorts for the base branch of the LandSandBoat project. We actively pull new content from the LandSandBoat project and actively report back any issues discovered to them.</p>
